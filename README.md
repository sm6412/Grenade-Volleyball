# Grenade-Volleyball
Grenade volleyball was a project I did in one of my Game Design classes. The prompt was to make a mod of the game “Arcade Volleyball”. In my mod I have two pairs of soldiers attempt to play volleyball with a grenade. If the timer runs out, the side that the grenade is on loses.
